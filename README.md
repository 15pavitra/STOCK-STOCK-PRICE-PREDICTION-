# STOCK-STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTION
Here is an even **shorter and simpler one-paragraph version**:  This project predicts stock prices using Python by cleaning historical data, analyzing trends, and applying models like Linear Regression, ARIMA, and LSTM. It compares model accuracy using RMSE/MAE and shows actual vs predicted prices through clear visual plots. 

🔑 Key Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning pipelines.
- Exploratory Data Analysis with visualizations.
- Multiple predictive models: Linear Regression, ARIMA, LSTM.
- Evaluation metrics for performance comparison.
- Interactive plots for trend analysis.

🎯 Purpose
This project is intended for students, researchers, and developers interested in financial data modeling. It serves as a foundation for building advanced trading or forecasting systems and can be extended with more sophisticated deep learning models for improved accuracy.
⚙️ Tech Stack
- Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit‑learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow/Keras
